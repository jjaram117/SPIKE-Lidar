# SPIKE-Lidar
The next step from the EV3-Lidar undergraduate research project. 

These scripts work in unison to communicate, mobilize, and visualize a LEGO SPIKE Prime robotics platform along with a Slamtec RPlidar sensor, and a Raspberry Pi 4 acting as the control computer. 

This system is capable of manual exploration via wireless inputs and data plotting, while a simple autonomous exploration mode is also available but currently being improved.
